We are glad to announce the release of Trajtracker, a python-based platform for creating trajectory tracking experiments on desktops / tablets / smartphones.

TrajTracker provides:

- A wide array of tools that, in our experience, are useful for creating a trajectory tracking experiment

- Two fully functional experimental paradigms with finger trajectory tracking: number-to-position mapping and two-button forced-choice task. Just install, copy one of the samples provided, create the list of stimuli to present, and you have an experiment.

- A Matlab toolbox for analyzing the results
