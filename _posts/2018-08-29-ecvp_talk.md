I'm gonna talk about <b><i>Brain mechanisms of arithmetic: a crucial role for ventral temporal cortex</i></b> at the <b>Numerical Vision</b> symposium organized by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/benharveylab/" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Ben Harvey</b></a> during the <a href="https://www.ecvp2018.org/" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>41st European Conference on Visual Perception</b></a>, from August 26-30th 2018, in Trieste, Italy.

The other speakers are: <a href="http://www.pisavisionlab.org/index.php/people/faculty/burr" class="ext"><b>David Burr</b></a>, <a ref="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele_Fornaciai" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Michele Fornaciai</b></a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Wutz" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Andreas Wutz</b></a>.

<b>Abstract</b>  
Recent research demonstrates that the number of objects in an image (numerosity) is an important parameter for the visual system. This symposium explores links between
numerical vision and vision scienceâ€™s central topics. They include links to various visual
functions, from spatio-temporal integration in the early visual system, to working memory,
multisensory integration, object recognition, temporal perception and eye movements.
They also include neural mechanisms found throughout the visual system: adaptation,
neural tuning functions, topographic maps and visual evoked potentials. Our speakers
explore these links using various advanced behavioral, neuroimaging and computational
methods, placing numerical vision in mainstream of vision science.
